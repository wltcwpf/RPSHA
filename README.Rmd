RPSHA stands for Regional Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment. This package is developed to conduct the conventional PSHA for independent sites in California using UCERF3 source model. More importantly, this package implements LASSO regression for event selection and ground motion map selection to assess seismic hazard for regional distributed infrastructures that are no longer independent but spatially distributed. 

Note, this package is still under development. 

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("wltcwpf/RPSHA")
```
